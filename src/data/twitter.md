Twitter is a microblogging and social networking service owned by American company Twitter, Inc., on which users post
and interact with messages known as "tweets". Registered users can post, like, and retweet tweets, while unregistered
users only have a limited ability to read public tweets. Users interact with Twitter through browser or mobile frontend
software, or programmatically via its APIs. Prior to April 2020, services were accessible via SMS. Tweets were
originally restricted to 140 characters, but the limit was doubled to 280 for non-CJK languages in November 2017. Audio
and video tweets remain limited to 140 seconds for most accounts.

Twitter was created by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams in March 2006 and launched in July of that
year. Twitter, Inc. is based in San Francisco, California and has more than 25 offices around the world. By 2012, more
than 100 million users posted 340 million tweets a day, and the service handled an average of 1.6 billion search queries
per day. In 2013, it was one of the ten most-visited websites and has been described as "the SMS of the Internet". By
the start of 2019, Twitter had more than 330 million monthly active users. In practice, the vast majority of tweets are
written by a minority of users.

On April 25, 2022, the Twitter board of directors agreed to a $44 billion buyout by Elon Musk, making it one of the
biggest deals to take a company private. After a protracted period of controversy and legal battles, the deal closed on
October 27.
